/**
 * Does a long streamed response survive this deployment?
 *
 * Long build turns come back truncated in production and never locally: the
 * same request three times gave one finished and two that stopped mid-file,
 * HTTP 200, no error part, no finish event. Everything in the chat route was
 * a suspect — the model, the tools, the segment loop, the watchdog — and
 * narrowing it down by changing the chat route means guessing.
 *
 * This streams bytes and nothing else. No model, no tools, no database. If a
 * response from here also stops early then the request never had a chance and
 * the cause is the runtime, not what the chat route does with it.
 *
 *   /api/stream-check?chunks=400&delay=50   → 400 chunks over 20 seconds
 *
 * The last line is `END <n>`, so a truncated response is one that does not
 * have it. Signed-in only: it costs nothing to serve but there is no reason
 * to leave a traffic generator open to the world.
